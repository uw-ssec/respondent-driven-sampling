# API Documentation 

This documentation describes the API that serves the RDS web app - a full-stack web application designed to streamline data collection and participant tracking using Respondent-Driven Sampling (RDS) methods. This system enables survey administrators to securely manage participant entries, authenticate users, and monitor referral-based outreach efforts, all while prioritizing accessibility, security, and ease of use. The API for the RDS web app contains endpoints that performs integral functionaltiy 

There are two primary routes in the RDS Web API. The `auth` route has endpoints that facilitate all user tasks. Some of these tasks include signing users in, fetching user profiles or editing user permissions. The `surveys` route has endpoints that facilitate survey tasks. These tasks include things such as fetching surveys, submitting surveys or deleting surveys. 

To ensure security we use an auth token system to verify requestor's idenity. The auth tokens are JSON Web Tokens signed by the backend server that include the user's first name, role, and employeeId. These tokens are generated on successful signup or login and are checked every time a privileged request is made.

### Auth Middleware and Permissions

Some requests are privileged in that they require the user has special permissions for the request to be completed. For this it is required that the user is logged in and sends their auth token in the header of the request. In this case we have an auth middleware that handles verifying that the token is valid and not expired. The user's account is also checked to make sure they have been approved. Its also within this middleware that the user's list of permissions is acquired and added to the request for the endpoints to then use. For a more detailed desciption of user permissions look at the [database documentation](./database.md).

Along with these checks comes possible errors that all privileged requests have in common. We will list these errors here instead of within each of the privileged requests desciptions.

- `401` "Access denied. No token provided"
  - This means no token was provided in the Authorization header or the header was malformed.

- `401` "Access Denied. Invalid Token: ..."
  - This means the token was invalid for some reason, more information will be included in the error message.

- `403` "User account not approved yet. Please contact your admin."
  - This means the account making the request has not been approved.

- `404` "User account not found. Please contact your admin."
  - This means the account linked to the token was not found in the database. Possibly got deleted after issuing a token.

## Survey Endpoints

**Error Handling:**

  - This means that the `role` provide was invalid (as its the only field we check for validity). For a role to be valid it must be either "Volunteer", "Manager", or "Admin".

- `403` "Access denied. Invalid user permissions"
  - The user did not have the correct permissions for the request. This is checked against the database not the client side list of permissions.

- `403` "Access denied. Insufficient user role"
  - The role of the user sending the request was lower than that of the user they were attempting to approve.

- `404` "User not found."
  - No user was found with provided employeeId.

- `500` "Server error: Unable to update user profile"
  - This error occurs when there is an error in the server.
