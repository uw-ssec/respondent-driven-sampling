The purpose of this consent form is to give you the information you will need to help you decide whether to be in the study or not. Please read the form carefully. You may ask questions about the purpose of the research, what we would ask you to do, the possible risks and benefits, your rights as a volunteer, and anything else about the research or this form that is not clear. When we have answered all your questions, you can decide if you want to be in the study or not. This process is called \"informed consent.\" We will give you a copy of this form for your records.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\">This is a research study focused on innovating better methods to enumerate individuals experiencing homelessness. This study is led by Drs. Zack W. Almquist, Amy Hagopian and June Yang at the University of Washington. We hope to learn more about the number and demographics of individuals' experiencing homelessness through their social networks. You are being asked to take part in this study as a person currently experiencing homelessness.</p>\n\n<div style=\"background-color: #e7f3ff; border-left: 4px solid #2196F3; padding: 15px; margin: 20px 0;\">\n<h4 style=\"color: #1976D2; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 12px;\">Key Information</h4>\n<ul style=\"margin-bottom: 0; padding-left: 20px;\">\n\t<li style=\"margin-bottom: 8px;\">Taking part is your choice.</li>\n\t<li style=\"margin-bottom: 8px;\">If you join, we will ask you to do a 10–15 minute survey about your housing, health, and people you know who are also experiencing homelessness.</li>\n\t<li style=\"margin-bottom: 8px;\">You will receive a <strong>$20 cash card or electronic payment</strong> for doing the survey, and <strong>$5 for each person you successfully recruit</strong> (up to three people).</li>\n\t<li style=\"margin-bottom: 8px;\">Questions may feel personal (for example, about health, substance use, or housing history). You can skip any question or stop at any time and still get paid.</li>\n\t<li style=\"margin-bottom: 8px;\">We will keep your information confidential to the extent allowed by law. We will ask for some limited identifying information so we don't count you twice and so we can contact you for possible follow-up. We will store this information securely, separate from your survey answers.</li>\n\t<li style=\"margin-bottom: 0;\">If you later decide to stop, we will stop collecting new information from you, but we will keep and continue to use data already collected, including any data that have already been de-identified and combined with other participants.</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"margin-top: 12px; margin-bottom: 0; font-style: italic;\">Please read the sections below for more detail.</p>\n</div>\n\n<h4 style=\"color: #444; margin-top: 25px; margin-bottom: 10px;\">PURPOSE OF THE STUDY</h4>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\">The purpose of this study is to collect information about the number and characteristics of people who are currently experiencing homelessness. We also want to investigate the timing and social networks of people who are currently unhoused.</p>\n\n<h4 style=\"color: #444; margin-top: 25px; margin-bottom: 10px;\">STUDY PROCEDURES</h4>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\">To better understand the number of people experiencing homelessness, their demographics and social networks, we will survey household heads 18 and older.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\">This study is being done in the form of a survey. If you decide to participate in the survey, you will be asked to discuss your experiences with homelessness and social networks of people you know who are also experiencing homelessness. It will take about 10 minutes to complete the survey.</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 8px;\"><strong>Risks:</strong> Risks of this study are minimal, though there are questions which inquire about personal and/or sensitive content. Participants can refuse to answer any question or discontinue the interview at any point without repercussion. Every effort will be made to keep responses confidential, and responses will not affect any of your current or subsequent benefits.</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 8px;\"><strong>Benefits:</strong> Participation in this study will contribute to shared knowledge on homelessness from those who are experiencing it first-hand.</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 8px;\"><strong>Compensation:</strong> Participants will receive a $20 prepaid visa card after completing the survey questionnaire. We will also give you a $5 gift card for each person (also experiencing homelessness) who you recruit to participate in this study (up to three people/gift cards).</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\"><strong>Voluntary Participation:</strong> Your participation in this study is voluntary. You can decide to participate or not to participate, or to withdraw at any time without penalty or loss of benefits to which you are entitled.</p>\n\n<h4 style=\"color: #444; margin-top: 25px; margin-bottom: 10px;\">What happens to the information collected for the research?</h4>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\">We will not keep any personal identifying information about you after the study period.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\">The data we collect will be confidential. We will protect the privacy of the participants by coding all data sheets and files with a participant identification number. If we learn that the participant intends to harm themselves or others, however, we are legally obligated to report that to a mental health official.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\">Sometimes government or university staff review studies like this to make sure they are being done safely and legally. If a review takes place, they may look at study records. They will protect your privacy, and your information will not be used to put you at legal risk.</p>\n\n<h4 style=\"color: #444; margin-top: 25px; margin-bottom: 10px;\">DATA RETENTION AND WITHDRAWAL</h4>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\">Because this is a multi-year project, we need to keep your data for some time.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\">We will keep your survey answers and the link between your name/contact information and your study ID for as long as needed to:</p>\n<ul style=\"margin-bottom: 15px; padding-left: 25px;\">\n\t<li>Finish this study,</li>\n\t<li>Conduct closely related studies about homelessness, and</li>\n\t<li>Meet University of Washington and state/federal records-retention rules (these rules generally require keeping data for several years after a study ends).</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\">We may use your de-identified survey data (data with names and direct contact information removed) in future research related to homelessness and housing. We may also share de-identified data with other researchers under formal data-sharing agreements. Your name and direct contact information will not be shared with other researchers without additional IRB approval or your additional consent.</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 8px; margin-top: 20px;\"><strong>What if I withdraw from the study?</strong></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\">If you decide to stop participating, we will stop collecting new information from you and will not contact you again for this study (unless you later tell us you want to re-join).</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\">However, we will keep and continue to use the information already collected about you, including any data that have already been de-identified and combined with others. Once your data are combined and analyzed, they cannot be separated out.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\">We will also keep certain identifiers (such as your date of birth and name initials) and the code that links those to your survey ID, as allowed by UW policy and law. Because we keep these identifiers even if you withdraw, you may decide that you do not want to participate.</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 8px; margin-top: 20px;\"><strong>What will be shared with others?</strong></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\">We may share group-level results (for example, \"X% of people report Y\") with KCRHA, local governments, HUD, community organizations, and in academic publications.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\">Your name or direct contact information will not appear in any reports or publications.</p>\n\n<h4 style=\"color: #444; margin-top: 25px; margin-bottom: 10px;\">Whom can I talk to?</h4>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\">If you have any questions or concerns about this project, you may contact:</p>\n<ul style=\"list-style: none; padding-left: 0; margin-bottom: 15px;\">\n\t<li>Dr. Zack Almquist – <a href=\"mailto:zalmquis@uw.edu\">zalmquis@uw.edu</a></li>\n\t<li>Dr. Amy Hagopian – <a href=\"mailto:hagopian@uw.edu\">hagopian@uw.edu</a></li>\n\t<li>Dr. June Yang – <a href=\"mailto:jyang32@uw.edu\">jyang32@uw.edu</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\">If you have questions about your rights as a research subject or complaints about the research, contact:</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px; padding-left: 20px;\"><strong>Human Subjects Division (HSD) – University of Washington</strong><br>\nPhone: (206) 543-0098<br>\nEmail: <a href=\"mailto:hsdinfo@uw.edu\">hsdinfo@uw.edu</a></p>\n\n<h4 style=\"color: #444; margin-top: 25px; margin-bottom: 10px;\">CONSENT</h4>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\">Participation in research is voluntary.
